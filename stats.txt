To get one-number stats from MQKS server,
please update "HOST" in "mqks_eval" script and use the next spells:

./mqks_eval 'state.published'                                                   # How many messages were published.
./mqks_eval 'state.queued'                                                      # How many copies of messages were put to queues.
./mqks_eval 'state.consumed'                                                    # How many messages were consumed from queues.
./mqks_eval 'len(state.queues)'                                                 # How many queues exist now.
./mqks_eval 'sum(q.qsize() for q in state.queues.values())'                     # How many messages is stored in queues now.
./mqks_eval 'len(state.queues_by_events)'                                       # How many events are queues subscribed to.
./mqks_eval 'len([cs for cs in state.consumer_ids_by_clients.values() if cs])'  # How many clients have consumers.
./mqks_eval 'len(state.queues_by_consumer_ids)'                                 # How many consumers exist now.
./mqks_eval 'sum(len(ms) for ms in state.messages_by_consumer_ids.values())'    # How many consumed messages are waiting for ack or reject.
./mqks_eval '" ".join(" ".join(ms.keys()) for ms in state.messages_by_consumer_ids.values() if ms)'
                                                                                # List of consumed messages waiting for ack or reject.
./mqks_eval 'len(state.queues_to_delete_when_unused)'                           # How many queues will be deleted when unused by consumers.
./mqks_eval 'len([u for u in state.queues_used.values() if u.is_set()])'        # How many queues are used by consumers now.
./mqks_eval 'sum(q.qsize() for q in state.responses_by_clients.values())'       # How many responses are ready to be sent to client.
./mqks_eval 'len(state.socks_by_clients)'                                       # How many clients are connected.

./mqks_eval 'log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)'
